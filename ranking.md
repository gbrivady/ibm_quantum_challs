# Ranking

From the main page, you can see how many participants have completed the same amount of exercices. This is basically a report of this page, and I try to get it updated as soon as I get the "success" for a given lab, or exercice if I'm stuck :)

## Spring 2023

Time is completion time, basically my time - availability time. FYI, my TZ is Paris - so `UTC+2` for this challenge.
Rank is taken from the challenge page [here](https://challenges.quantum-computing.ibm.com/spring-2023) as soon as I get the last good result from grader cell. Does not mean much, but I am pretty competitive :)

| Lab # | Rank | Time, hh-mm |
| ----: | ---: | ----: |
| 1     |  407 | >2:00 |
| 2     |    2 | 00:10 |
| 3     |    8 | 00:47 |
