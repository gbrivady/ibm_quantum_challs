# Ranking

From the main page, you can see how many participants have completed the same amount of exercices. This is basically a report of this page, and I try to get it updated as soon as I get the "success" for a given lab, or exercice if I'm stuck :)

## Spring 2023

Time is completion time, basically my time - availability time. FYI, my TZ is Paris - so `UTC+2` for this challenge.
